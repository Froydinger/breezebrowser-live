# Android development status

## September 23 verification

- The existing Breeze Cloud chat Worker serves the mobile response route. Deployed version: `6ec70490-4311-404f-ac9a-ab90f2cef16c`; configured model: `gpt-6-luna` with web search.
- Five live Cloud checks passed for chat, research, fact-check, summarize, and YouTube. The completed responses and event summaries are in [cloud-results.json](qa/cloud-results.json).
- Emulator checks covered a conversational `hey`, research with clickable citations and source links, and `/summarize` on example.com using actual rendered page text. The chat composer remained visible with the keyboard open.
- Dark/light theme and screen captures are available under [qa/screenshots](qa/screenshots), including `final-keyboard-light.png`, `final-research-result-dark.png`, and `final-summary-light.png`. Older unprefixed captures include intermediate failures and are not final acceptance evidence.
- Independent Luna-agent visual review passed the revised reference screens; see [VISUAL-REVIEW.md](qa/VISUAL-REVIEW.md). The current build was installed on Pixel 11 over wireless ADB at `192.168.12.230:37113`; the app process was present and no current-PID fatal exception was found in the sampled log. The phone was at its lock screen during this pass, so current-build visual behavior on Pixel is not verified. Emulator screenshots confirm the page preview morph in both directions. These checks do not claim exhaustive feature verification.
- Emulator camera check passed Android permission, origin-specific site consent, and live video. Local vault authentication and saving a synthetic login passed. Microphone/location and website autofill are implemented but have not yet received equivalent end-to-end checks.
- The APK is a private development build containing a private debug credential. Do not distribute it publicly or through Play.
- The local password vault is encrypted with Android Keystore and requires device authentication. Website passkey provider authorization remains a release requirement; no incomplete provider toggle is exposed.

No broader release readiness is implied by the checks above.
